In this challenge we're going to get meta and build a form builder. It looks complex, but with the JSX already in place, your primary job is to manage the formFields array. The user will need to be able to add items to it, update items in it, and remove items from it.

All of the functions with their parameters are in place, you'll just need to examine the JSX and update each accordingly.

TASKS
Allow users to add a form field
Allow users to delete form fields
Allow users to update form field values
Allow users to submit the dynamic form with the new values
