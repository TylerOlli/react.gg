In this challenge, you're going to implement the logic for an input field that accepts a password. However, instead of a boring input field, this one is like... slightly less boring.

What makes it less boring is it gives the user the option to toggle the visibility of the password by giving them a button with some cute emojis, ðŸ™Š or ðŸ™ˆ depending on if the password is visible.

All the JSX is in place, all you need to do is properly handle the different states of the component and update handleChange and handleToggleVisibility so that the component behaves as expected.

TASKS
Update the password length count when the input changes
Update the text style based on the password length threshold
Allow users to toggle the password visibility
Show an alert with a success message when the password length is equal to or above the threshold on form submission
Show an alert with an error message when the password length is below the threshold on form submission
