You may have noticed that in our last "Light Switch" example, we had some wasted keystrokes. Specifically, depending on how you set it up, you may have written two methods (handleDarkMode and handleLightMode) for updating our mode state like in our current starting code. Also, we rendered two buttons, one for each event handler.

In this challenge, consolidate our logic into a single event handler and a single button element.

TASKS
The app renders without crashing
mode defaults to dark
mode toggles between dark and light when the button is clicked
