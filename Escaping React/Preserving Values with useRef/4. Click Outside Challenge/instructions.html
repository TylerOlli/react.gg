In this challenge you'll be adding a modal experience to the app. The user needs to be able to open the model and then close it either by clicking the close icon in the modal itself, or by clicking anywhere outside of the modal.

You'll need both component state and a reference to the modal to make it work properly.

TASKS
Don't render the modal by default
Clicking the 'Open Modal' button should open the modal
Don't close the modal when the dialog is clicked
Close modal by clicking close icon
Close the modal when the user clicks outside of the modal
