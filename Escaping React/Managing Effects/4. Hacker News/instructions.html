In this challenge, we'll be fetching data from the Hacker News API. However, unlike the other effects challenges, the state and event handlers for this one don't need updating. Instead, given the fetchData function, you'll need to synchronize your component with the Hacker News API and then update the JSX appropriately.

This one is tricky so take your time and think it through. Anywhere in the JSX you see null or TODO you'll need to update it.

TASKS
