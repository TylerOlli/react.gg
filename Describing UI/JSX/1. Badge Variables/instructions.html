We have a Badge component with variables for name, handle and img that are unassigned. Your job is to assign those variables in the JSX so that the component renders correctly.

TASKS
Give the image a proper alt tag using the author's name
Make sure the badge displays the profile image correctly
Display the author's name in the badge's heading
Display the author's handle below the heading
